# Ubuntu White Edition — Professional Installer

**Project:** Ubuntu Determinant  
**Edition:** Ubuntu White Edition  
**Project attention:** Max Rupplin — MEARVK LLC — 2026

## Purpose

`installer/` is the master installation interface for Ubuntu White Edition and the repository's recent native tools. It keeps the JavaFX control surface separate from platform-specific native installation work.

## Master installation

The current native tool set is maintained by `installer/install-manifest.txt` and includes:

- `xmc` — XMC compiler and ASYSMA packaging path;
- `limit` — executable identity/metadata inspection;
- `size` — recursive logical filesystem-size measurement;
- `ctrmsctl` — read-only disk/filesystem observation service;
- `tac3ctl` — userspace diagnostic for the in-kernel TAC3 filesystem;
- GCC source download/extraction helpers.

### Manifest-driven: adding technology without rebuilding the installer

`installer/install-manifest.txt` is a plain list (`component|source|install-name|default`)
read at runtime by the `package-installer` binary. Adding a new component is a
**data change to the manifest, not a code change** — the `package-installer`
binary does not need to be recompiled. To add technology:

1. put the built artifact under `tools/<name>/` (with a `build.sh`/`Makefile`);
2. add one line to `install-manifest.txt`: `id|tools/<name>|<artifact>|<default>`;
3. `package-installer --list` / `--disc <id>` / `--function <kw>` pick it up
   immediately.

`tac3ctl` was added exactly this way. This keeps the cost of onboarding new
tools to a single manifest line.

Use the platform master installer:

```text
Linux:   ./installer/install-all.sh
Windows: .\installer\install-all.ps1
macOS:   ./installer/install-all-macos.sh
```

The master installer first invokes the native installer for the host. When Java and Maven are available, it also builds the JavaFX installer package.

### Native installers

```text
installer/install-native.sh
installer/install-native.ps1
installer/install-native-macos.sh
```

These compile the repository's native C utilities locally. XMC is built through its own `tools/xmc/Makefile`, preserving its multi-binary contract (`xmc`, `xmc-core`, `asysma_pack`, and related launcher/assets) rather than treating `xmc-driver.c` as a standalone executable. The XMC Makefile explicitly defines the integrated compiler/package installation targets. fileciteturn79file0L2-L2

## Operating modes

| Mode | Function | Destructive authority |
|---|---|---|
| Build ISO | Assemble an ISO using the repository build contract | None beyond build output |
| Root-directory install | Install an already-built root filesystem into a selected directory | Explicit directory only |
| Named-partition install | Prepare/mount a user-selected partition and install | Requires explicit confirmation and elevated helper |
| Run existing ISO | Launch an ISO without installing | None |
| Virtual machine | Boot an ISO through QEMU/Hyper-V/WSL-compatible path | VM-scoped |
| Inspect | Detect host, ISO, rootfs, partitions, VM tools | Read-only |

Partition operations must never be inferred from a directory name. The UI must display the exact device, filesystem, mount state, and intended operation before elevation.

## Professional launcher

The launcher is Java/JavaFX-oriented. The master install scripts build the native inspection/observation utilities first and then build the JavaFX package when its toolchain is available.

The installer should use a small JavaFX launcher and delegate privileged/platform-specific work to explicit adapters rather than embedding shell commands throughout the GUI.

```text
JavaFX Launcher
    |
    +-- Host Detector
    +-- Native Tool Installer
    +-- XMC / ASYSMA Adapter
    +-- Limit / Size Inspection
    +-- CTRMS Observation Adapter
    +-- ISO Builder Adapter
    +-- Rootfs Adapter
    +-- Partition Adapter
    +-- VM Adapter
    +-- Verification / Audit
```

## Security boundary

The JavaFX process should normally run unprivileged. Operations requiring root/administrator access must cross a small, auditable helper boundary.

The GUI must not execute arbitrary user-entered shell strings. All operations should use typed arguments and allow-listed commands.

`limit`, `size`, and the CTRMS observation surface remain read-only inspection/measurement functions. `ctrmsctl` may install its systemd service when running on a systemd host, but the service itself is an observation component rather than an authorization mechanism.

## State model

```text
DISCOVER
  -> PLAN
  -> REVIEW
  -> CONFIRM
  -> ELEVATE (only when required)
  -> EXECUTE
  -> VERIFY
  -> REPORT
```

No install operation should jump directly from discovery to execution.

## Existing build integration

The existing ISO and Ubuntu installer paths remain the established image/provisioning contracts. This master installer adds the recent native-tool installation layer rather than silently replacing those paths.

## Native install binaries (installer/linux)

`installer/linux/` holds three committed native ELF binaries that support the install path. Consistent with the framing above, the orchestrator adds a smooth front door and delegates to the established contracts rather than replacing them.

- `white-installer`: the smooth-install orchestrator ELF and default front door. It runs a seven-stage guided flow (PROBE, PREVIEW read-only, COMPONENTS, TARGET, CONFIRM, DELEGATE, AUDIT) with checkbox and command-line component selection. It is a control plane that delegates to `scripts/galactic-cherry-installer` rather than reimplementing disk or package logic, runs unprivileged, and defaults to a safe dry-run. This is the headline new binary.
- `desktop_install_probe`: the existing Step-1 discovery and bootstrap probe. It locates the clone and the install set, previews and performs dry-run discovery, and can carry out an explicit install. It already exists and is listed here for context.
- `nxtt`: the NXTT uninstaller helper ELF.
- `package-installer`: installs the repository's package software **directly** into **edition-aware** destination trees. Selection is by **disc** (`--disc <name>`, a named bundle from `install-manifest.txt`; `--disc all` takes everything) or by **function** (`--function <keyword>`, matching component id/install-name). Unlike `white-installer` it does not delegate to the Bash engine — it copies the resolved artifacts itself. It still follows the White Edition safety contract: the default run is a dry-run that plans and reports but writes nothing; use `--install` to actually copy. See `INSTALL.md`.

  **Edition-aware destinations.** On **Ubuntu White Edition** the tools install into the White Edition trees `/deck/bin`, `/user/bin`, and `/system/bin`. On a **standard** (non-White) Ubuntu they fall back to the FHS locations `/usr/bin` and `/sbin`. The edition is detected at runtime with this precedence (so a stock system is never mistaken for White Edition):

  1. `--edition white|standard|auto` flag;
  2. `PKG_EDITION` environment variable (`white`/`standard`);
  3. the `/etc/ubuntu-white-edition` marker file → White;
  4. `/etc/os-release` branding (VARIANT/PRETTY_NAME/ID mentions "White Edition") → White;
  5. both `/deck` and `/user` already exist → White;
  6. otherwise → standard (FHS).

  Detection is read-only and makes no privileged/account/systemd/cron changes; it only chooses where the plain file copies go.

These build from `installer/linux/Makefile`:

```text
make -C installer/linux all
```

A portable static build of the orchestrator is available for the live ISO and minimal environments:

```text
make -C installer/linux white-installer-static
```

See [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) for detailed usage.
