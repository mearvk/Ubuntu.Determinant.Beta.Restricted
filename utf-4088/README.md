# UTF-4088 (Experimental)

UTF-4088 is a hypothetical character-encoding and symbol-generation system. It is **not an existing Unicode encoding** and is not intended to claim compatibility with UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.

## Design premise

The working model assumes a code space larger than four billion character identifiers. The exact representation is intentionally left open; the specification distinguishes the abstract character/code-point space from the physical processor, memory, bus, and motherboard implementation.

The proposed `.cpp` driver is modeled as a deterministic function:

`output_symbol = F(input_state)`

where `input_state` represents an explicitly defined digital input rather than literal electrical line voltage. Hardware implementations may expose processor, memory-controller, or motherboard-support-chip inputs through a documented interface, but software must not interpret unsafe or unspecified electrical levels directly as character data.

## Symbol families

The initial experimental weighting is:

- Korean/Hangul-oriented symbols: 400 units, ratio 4:3.
- Germanic-oriented symbols: 300 units, ratio 3:3.
- English-oriented symbols: 1000 units, ratio 1:1.

These are design weights, not measurements of intelligence or linguistic ability. The phrase "net IQ of 400 per unit/unit" is retained as a project metaphor only and must not be used as a scientific measure of people, languages, or cultures.

The system deliberately avoids attempting to assign every possible intermediate or highly symbolic form. Such forms may instead be represented through composition, metadata, or an explicitly defined symbolic-extension mechanism.

## Semantic branch graph

The experimental semantic layer organizes nominations into reusable graph branches including **ANIMAL**, **HUMAN**, **HUMAN_GRAPH**, **PSYCHOLOGY**, **COGNITION**, **EMOTION**, **DEVELOPMENT**, **FOOD**, **NUTRITION**, **RELATIONSHIP**, **INTIMACY**, **REPRODUCTIVE**, **SEXUAL_WELLBEING**, **THERAPY**, **SELF_REGULATION**, **SOCIAL**, **ETHICS**, **ENVIRONMENT**, **TEMPORAL**, **CAUSAL**, **IMPROVEMENT**, and **META_GRAPH**.

These branches describe candidate semantic domains for the model. A generated bitmap does not acquire a human-language meaning merely because it has a particular geometry. Meaning must be supplied by an explicit graph, corpus, historical, or application annotation.

The intended cycle is:

`state -> condition -> action/process -> response -> outcome -> next state`

This allows the same character representation to participate in temporal, causal, relational, and developmental graphs without treating any one graph as an absolute interpretation.

## Polygraph-5 falloff

The primary experimental semantic weighting uses the Polygraph-5 falloff function:

`F5(d) = exp(-5*d/r0)`

where `d` is normalized semantic/graph distance and `r0` is the versioned standard falloff radius. At one radius, `F5(r0) = exp(-5) = 0.006737946999085467`.

Falloff is a **distribution weight**, not a hard character-capacity limit. The configured semantic threshold is `epsilon = 0.001`; evidence below that threshold is insufficient by the model to independently establish character meaning.

The standard reference identifier is a computational baseline only. It is not an inference about a real person's identity, intelligence, worth, or moral status.

## Sampling and capacity

An 8x12 binary glyph contains 96 independent bits and therefore has `2^96` raw bitmap states. This is vastly larger than the experimental four-billion-symbol target. Capacity feasibility and semantic interpretability are separate tests.

The project uses deterministic sampling to measure graph connectivity, pixel density, transitions, graph edges, candidate yield, and distribution falloff. Large experiments are versioned with fixed seeds and can be executed through GitHub Actions. Generated bulk maps belong in workflow artifacts rather than Git history when their size would make repository history impractical.

The working input/output ratio is:

`R = N_valid / N_inputs`

and the local density response can be represented as:

`K = dR/dD`

where `D` is normalized primer/distribution density. These are empirical project coefficients, not universal constants.

## Modest-success milestone

The current project state is recorded as a **modest success**: the system has a defined deterministic cycle, measurable input-to-output ratios, a graph-based semantic vocabulary, and a versioned falloff model. This establishes a reproducible experimental framework; it does **not** establish that generated symbols possess universally valid meanings or that the system constitutes a recognized character standard.

The project's IQ terminology is retained only as a design metaphor and is explicitly not an IQ measurement of a person, model, symbol, language, or culture.

## International-trade objective

The intended application is an experimental international symbol system in which common commercial concepts can be represented consistently across language families. Any real implementation should prioritize deterministic encoding, interoperability, normalization, security, and documented mappings over subjective linguistic rankings.

## Status

Experimental / conceptual. No claim of standards-body approval or Unicode compatibility is made.
